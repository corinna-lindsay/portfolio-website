						I created the landing page for a fictitious food truck company from a Photoshop design comp. This was my first experience hand coding a website from scratch, as all my previous websites had been created using Dreamweaver. I really enjoyed the process of being in control and hands on with the coding process.

						I created the branding and website for a small trucking company based in Pennsylvania. I was able to build upon skills that I&apos;d learned while creating the House Of Ming website, and add additional features such a drop down menu, rollover images, CSS3 drop shadows and sleek graphical elements. I am currently in the process of redesigning this site as a sleek and modern one page site. Stay tuned!

						This is the first website I ever created, way back in 2012, for a boutique motion picture company based in Brooklyn NY. There were many things I didn&apos;t know how to do before I started, so I had to learn as went along. Some of the challenges included creating image and video galleries, embedding a Twitter feed, creating a mailing list subscription form, and adding a password protected page.

    					<h4>Hi, I'm Corinna Lindsay. I am a British New Yorker <br> and I love to create!</h4>
						
						<p class="body-text">
						I worked as a graphic designer in the UK magazine industry for almost a decade. But as the publishing industry gradually started to move towards digital formats, I decided to increase my skill set by learning to code.
						</p>

						<p class="body-text">
						I completed a Dreamweaver course and created websites for my first few clients. But I soon realized my skills were still very limited when I was unable to give my clients all the fancy features they wanted for their sites. After several years of freelance design work, I decided to take my coding skills further by signing up to Skillcrush&apos;s Break Into Tech Blueprint, with the aim of being a full stack developer. This portfolio website is actually a skillcrush project that I hand-coded from scratch from a Photoshop design comp.
						</p>

						<p class="body-text">
						Given my background as a designer, I believe in being very hands on throughout the entire process of launching a website, from branding, design and user experience right through to coding, launch and marketing.
